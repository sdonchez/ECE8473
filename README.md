# ECE 8473 - Unix and C Programming - Fall 2021

This repository contains coursework implementing the assignments for ECE 8473 - Unix and C Programming for the Fall 2021 semester. The various assignments contained herein consist of a collection of shell scripts and C programs which perform various tasks to demonstrate understanding of the concepts covered by the course.

## Assignment Contents
- [Assignment 1:](Assignment1/) Prints various constants from standard headers, as well as demonstrating error handling functionality, all in C.
- [Assignment 2:](Assignment2/) Implements two random value generators, as well as a random number guessing game, all in shell scripts.
- [Assignment 3:](Assignment3/) Makes the random number guessing game from Assignment 2 interactive, and also implements a Pseudo-Random Number Generator in C.
- [Assignment 4:](Assignment4/) Implements 3 decryption engines

## Development Environment
The development environment used for this course consists of a Windows 10 Intel x64 machine (10.0.19043 Build 19043).

Shell Scripts were authored in Visual Studio Code v1.60.2. All scripts have been tested and found to produce no warnings or errors with both GNU bash, version 5.0.17(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu), and dash version 0.5.10.2-6.

C applications were authored in Visual Studio 2019 (Version 16.11.3), and compiled in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 running Ubuntu 20.04. The compiler utilized is gcc version 9.3.0. GNU Make 4.2.1 was used to process Makefiles.
